# tutrIt club: java quickstart 

---

# Environment installation
Here the list of environment tools we'll use for study on course\
1. We gona use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as primary IDE. You need to install it, community version would be fine.
2. Here [Open Jdk](https://jdk.java.net/archive//) you can download java development kit for your OS. It's ok to use the latest version.
3. It is complicated to set up JAVA_HOME for Windows OS, and it is much more easy to study on Linux. Anyway, here you can find good instruction how install JDK and setup JAVA_HOME on [Windows](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-on-windows-10/), [Linux](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-add-java_home-on-ubuntu/), and [MacOS](https://mkyong.com/java/how-to-set-java_home-environment-variable-on-mac-os-x/)
4. We will use [Maven](https://mkyong.com/tutorials/maven-tutorials/) to build java project since the very first day. Must have installed.
5. And we will use git as version control system - so I suggest install [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/downloads). I suggest you this one - [Windows Git Client](https://git-scm.com/download/win) - you can work with it as in linux system
